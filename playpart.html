<div class="stockman"><p><h5>Dr. Stockmann.</h5></p></div>
<div class="speech"><p>Yes, sit down and we will have it comfortably.</p></div>

<div class="ps"><h5>Peter Stockmann.</h5></div>
<div class="speech"></div><p>Thanks, I never care about an evening's drinking.</p>

<div class="stockman"><p><h5>Dr. Stockmann.</h5></p></div>
<div class="speech"><p> But this isn't an evening's drinking.</p></div>

<div class="ps"><p><h5>Peter Stockmann.</h5></p></div>
<div class="speech"></div><p>It seems to me—. <div class="direction">[Looks towards the dining-room.]</p></div>
    <p> It is extraordinary how they can put away all that food.</p> </body>

    <div class="stockman"><p><h5>Dr. Stockmann</h5></p></div>
<div class="direction"><p>[rubbing his hands].</p></div>
<div class="speech"><p>Yes, isn't it splendid to see young
people eat? They have always got an appetite, you know! That's as it
should be. Lots of food—to build up their strength! They are the
people who are going to stir up the fermenting forces of the future,
Peter.</p></div>

<div class="ps"><p><h5>Peter Stockmann.</h5></p></div>
<div class="speech"><p>May I ask what they will find here to "stir up," as
you put it?</p></div>

<div class="stockman"><p><h5>Dr. Stockmann.</h5></p></div>
<div class="speech"><p>Ah, you must ask the young people that—when the times
comes. We shan't be able to see it, of course. That stands to
reason—two old fogies, like us.</p></div>
